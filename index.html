          is defined as an artistic way of arranging sound to create a
          combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or other expressive
          content. It is a part of every day life for many including myself.
          Music has a way to transform moods for the better and sometimes for
          the worse. It brings all of us together as it can manifest universal
          feelings that many times you cannot explain, you can just feel it.
          Music has always been my one constant in life and is healing to my
          soul.

        <div class="singing-description">
          is the act of creating musical sounds with your voice. Singing can be
          formal, informal, arranged, or even improvised. The sound of each
          individual's singing voice is entirely unique to them. Singing can be
          done as a profession, as a ritual, or even as a hobby. I once won a
          gold medal at a singing competition back in middle school. I used to
          be involved in choir throughout high school and now I sing for fun.
